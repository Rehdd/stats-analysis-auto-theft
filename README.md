# stats-analysis-auto-theft
This project was developed using R code and used data from the Toronto Police Service to determine if there is a relationship between the report times of vehicles stolen during 
typical work hours and outside those hours. The conclusions derived from the statistical analysis were used to advise the Toronto Police service in ways that could increase the 
retrieval rate of stolen vehicles.
