## The Problem
The Insurance Bureau of Canada highlights key reasons why cars are stolen$^1$:

1. Dismantling for parts
2. Sold abroad
3. Used for other crimes
\
\
These usually happen within 48 hours after the theft.\
\
Longer report times $\implies$ less likely to retrieve car.\

\
<center>**Reduce auto thefts, reduce other crimes.**</center>

## Objectives
* Analyze auto theft data from the Toronto Police Service
* Find interesting relationships between the factors of each theft
* Use our research to propose suggestions to help the Toronto Police Services to aid the recovery of stolen vehicles

## Introduction
* Research based on 18,178 auto thefts in Toronto gathered from 2000 to 2018 reported to the Toronto Police Service.
\
\
* Investigated factors that may influence the time it takes for an auto theft to be reported.
\
\
* We considered the time at which a vehicle was stolen:

## Initial Observations I
```{r, echo = FALSE}

data_obs_1 <- data_1 %>% mutate(cat_hour = ifelse(occurrencehour >= 16, yes = "16-23", ifelse(occurrencehour >= 0 & occurrencehour < 8, yes = "0-8", "8-16"))) %>% filter(reporttime < 48) 

data_obs_1$cat_hour <- factor(data_obs_1$cat_hour, levels = c("16-23", "8-16", "0-8"))

data_obs_1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = cat_hour, y = reporttime)) + geom_boxplot(color = "black", fill = "cornflowerblue") + labs(y = "Time Taken to Report Theft", x = "Hour Intervals in a Day") + coord_flip() 
```
Observing if a third of the day has longer average time taken to report theft.

## Initial Observations II
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}


data_obs_2 <- data_1 %>% mutate(cat_week = ifelse(occurrencedayofweek == "Monday    ", yes = "Monday", ifelse(occurrencedayofweek == "Tuesday   ", yes = "Tuesday", ifelse(occurrencedayofweek == "Wednesday ", yes = "Wednesday", ifelse(occurrencedayofweek == "Thursday  ", yes = "Thursday", ifelse(occurrencedayofweek == "Friday    ", yes = "Friday", ifelse(occurrencedayofweek == "Saturday  ", yes = "Saturday", "Sunday"))))))) %>% filter(reporttime < 48) 

data_obs_2$cat_week <- factor(data_obs_2$cat_week, levels = c("Sunday", "Saturday", "Friday", "Thursday", "Wednesday", "Tuesday", "Monday"))

data_obs_2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cat_week, y = reporttime)) + geom_boxplot(color = "black", fill = "cornflowerblue") + labs(y = "Time Taken to Report Theft", x = "Type of Day") + coord_flip()
```
Stronger right skew on Friday, Saturday, Sunday\
$\implies$ Longer mean time taken to report theft.

## The Research Question

**What is the relationship between the report times of vehicles stolen during typical work hours and outside those hours?**
\
\
\
**Report Time** - number of hours taken for an auto theft to be reported to the Toronto Police Service
\

\
**Working Hours** - typical work hours, (9:00 - 17:00) on weekdays


## Data Wrangling I
<center>**report time = reported hour - occurred hour**</center>
\
- calculated by the difference between the hour the car was reported stolen and the hour the car was stolen.\
\
- dependent variable in study

## Data Wrangling II
<center> Split data into cars stolen during work hours or otherwise </center>

## Data Observations
```{r, echo = FALSE}
test_stat1 <- data_1 %>%
  group_by(work_category) %>% summarise("Mean Report Times" = mean(reporttime))


test_stat1
```
Mean report time during work hours is about 272 hours, and outside work hours is 115 hours.\
\
This *suggests* that cars stolen during work hours take longer to be reported stolen on average in Toronto.

## The Test Statistic
The mean difference of report times in and outside work hours in the TPS dataset:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
test_stat <- data_1 %>%
  group_by(work_category) %>% summarise(means = mean(reporttime)) %>% summarise(abs(diff(means))) %>% as.numeric()

test_stat
```

* About 157 hours

## Statistical Methods
**Step 1: Two-sided Hypothesis Test**
\
**Purpose:** to analyze the difference between report times during work hours and outside work hours\

\
\
**Step 2: Confidence Interval**
\
**Purpose:** to develop an interval at which we are 95% confident that the true difference between the mean report times during work hours and outside work hours is in\


## The Hypothesis Test
**Null Hypothesis:**
The mean time for an auto-theft to be reported in Toronto is **equal** if the theft occurs during work hours or outside work hours.
\
\
**Alternative Hypothesis:**
The mean time for an auto-theft to be reported in Toronto is **not equal** if the theft occurs during work hours or outside work hours.
\
\
\
Run test using 10,000 simulations, and a significance level of 5%

## Results of Hypothesis Test
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Histogram of simulated statistics under the null hypothesis
data_frame(simulated_differences) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=simulated_differences)) + ggtitle("Estimated Sampling Distribution for Simulated Differences") + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, colour="black", fill = "aquamarine3") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = test_stat, color = "red") + geom_vline(xintercept = -(test_stat), color = "red") + labs(x = "Simulated Test Statistics")
```

## P-Value Interpretation
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Calculate pvalues
data_frame(simulated_differences) %>%
  filter(simulated_differences >= abs(test_stat)  | 
           simulated_differences <= -abs(test_stat)) %>%
  summarise(pvalue = n() / repetitions)
```
* Represents probability of obtaining an observation as or more extreme as 157 hours
* P-Value is < 0.001; strong evidence against the null hypothesis
* P-Value is < 0.05; reject the null hypothesis
* 0.01% chance of making a Type 1 Error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true)

## Hypothesis Test to Confidence Interval
* Thus, we have strong evidence against the null hypothesis (and reject it)
\
* Next, we conduct a confidence interval to form new insight on the difference between mean report times

## Confidence Interval Context & Reasoning
* Generate random bootstrap samples of the same size as the dataset\
\
* Calculate the difference in mean report times during and outside work hours for each bootstrap sample \
\
* Find an interval that may contain the true difference between mean report times

## Confidence Interval Results I
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#plot
left_line = quantile(boot_means$mean_time, c(0.025))
right_line = quantile(boot_means$mean_time, c(0.975))
ggplot(boot_means, aes(x=mean_time)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill="cadetblue", color="black") + geom_vline(xintercept = c(left_line, right_line), color = "red") + labs(x="Difference of Report Times (work hours - outside work hours) from Bootstrap Samples",
title="Bootstrap Sampling Distribution for Mean Difference of Report Times")

```

## Confidence Interval Results II
```{r, echo = FALSE}
quantile(boot_means$mean_time, c(0.025, 0.975))
```
* Confidence interval: (79.54, 247.25)
* 95% confident that the true difference of report times lies within this interval \
* Since 0 is not in this interval, we have more evidence against our null hypothesis \

## Limitations
* 95% confidence does not imply 95% probability
* Assumes that work hours for everyone is 9am - 5pm on weekdays
* Only based off of the Toronto Police Service Data; may not be applicable everywhere 

## Conclusion
<centre> We suggest that the Toronto Police Service </centre> \
\
\
- Educate the public on the importance of a quick report time \
\
- Expand neighbourhood watch programs for vehicles \
\
- Invest more police resources during work hours
